# BrainTumourDetection
## Abstract
Medical image processing is the most challenging and emerging field now a
days. Processing of MRI images becomes an integral part because of the fact
that it is easy to analyze them compared to CT Scan etc as morphological,
segmentation, contrast enhancement etc can be easily applied to them. This
paper describes the proposed strategy to detect extraction of brain tumour
from patients MRI scan images of the brain. This method incorporates with
some noise removal functions, segmentation and morphological operations
which are the basic concepts of image processing. Detection and extraction
of tumour from MRI scan images of the brain is done by using MATLAB
software.

## How to run
Clone this repository in your PC and run the file 'check.m'. You might want to change the path in the code to point towards the brain MRI you are interested in analysing first.
